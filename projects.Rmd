### Differentially Private Hypothesis Testing  

*May 2018 -- Present*


<img src="images/dpht.png" style="width:35%; border:1px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> Since May 2018, I've worked in a research group on problems in database privacy. In particular, we're focusing on the potential of nonparametric approaches to differentially private hypothesis testing. Differential privacy is a subfield of database anonymization where researchers can access sensitive information in a database (e.g. medical records) by sending a query (in our case, to run a hypothesis test) and being returned a privatized output (in our case, a noisy test statistic). Centrally, my role is to evaluate the power of the tests that the group develops through simulation in R. Source code for these projects can be found [here](https://github.com/simonpcouch/non-pm-dpht) and [here](https://github.com/simonpcouch/wilcoxon), and papers can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01635) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09364). An early report on the research, "A Differentially Private Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test", [tied for 1st prize](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usresp/2018/fall/winners) in the ASA-sponsored "Undergraduate Statistics Research Competition."

### Equity of Bikeshare Programs  

*October 2018 -- Present*

<img src="images/bikeshare.png" style="width:35%; border:1px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> Beginning as a final class project for Statistical Learning (MATH 243) at Reed College in Fall 2018, this research project focuses on making use of machine learning methods to quantify progress in equity of bikeshare programs in the United States. Making use of [my R package gbfs](https://github.com/ds-civic-data/gbfs) to scrape latitude/longitudes of over 6000 bikeshare stations across the country and joining that data with census demographic data, the project hopes to determine the features of a community that are most salient in predicting the location of these bikeshare station docks. A preliminary report on this research was awarded an [honorable mention](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usclap/2018/fall/winners) in the ASA-sponsored "Undergraduate Statistics Class Project Competition." Source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/simonpcouch/bikeshare).

### gbfs (R Package)

*January 2018 -- Current*

<img src="images/gbfs.png" style="width:35%; border:1px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> My collaborator Kaelyn Rosenberg and I initially built this tool as a class project in Case Studies in Data Science (MATH 241) at Reed College in Spring 2018. The [CRAN-published](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbfs/gbfs.pdf) R Package makes use of a standardized data format used by hundreds of bikeshare programs nationwide for releasing live information feeds on bikeshare dock station and bike information (e.g. the location of docks, current location of bikes on the road, number of available docks at a given dock, etc.) to provide a set of functions to easily query these .json feeds and convert them to rectangular R data. Source code for that project can be found [here](https://github.com/ds-civic-data/gbfs)!

### anyflights (R Package, no longer supported)

*December 2017 -- December 2018*

This R package, inspired by the well-known [nycflights13](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) data-only R package, supplies a set of functions to query air travel data. The main wrapper function, `anyflights`, grabs data for a user-given year and airport and returns a folder of tidied datasets with identical formatting to that in `nycflights13`. The thought was to allow for students learning the basics of R and the tidyverse through labs working with the `nycflights13` package to work with more recent data from their own hometowns or from the airport closest to their school. An instructor could use this package to generate a folder of data (~5MB) that could be distributed to students through Dropbox, GitHub, etc. As a result, students could make discoveries that could impact their own, real-life air travel decisions. The formatting and querying structure of the data changed very often, though, and I decided to stop maintaining the package in late 2018. The source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/simonpcouch/anyflights)--let me know if you're interested in maintaining this package!
