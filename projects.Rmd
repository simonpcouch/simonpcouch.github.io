### A Grammar for Hypothesis Testing in the Tidyverse

*September 2019 -- Present*

<img src="images/infer.png" style="width:30%; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> I recently started working under Reed Associate Professor of Statistics Andrew Bray on the R package [infer](https://github.com/tidymodels/infer), providing a framework for hypothesis testing in the R *tidyverse* setting. Initially, I am focusing on documentation improvements, testing coverage, and bug fixes. We then hope to move on to revising the core verbs of the package and implementing new functionality.

### General Bikeshare Feed Specification (R Package)

*January 2018 -- Present*

<img src="images/gbfs.png" style="width:35%; border:1px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> My collaborator Kaelyn Rosenberg and I initially built this tool as a class project in Case Studies in Data Science (MATH 241) at Reed College in Spring 2018. The [CRAN-published](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbfs/gbfs.pdf) R Package makes use of a standardized data format used by hundreds of bikeshare programs nationwide for releasing live information feeds on bikeshare dock station and bike information (e.g. the location of docks, current location of bikes on the road, number of available docks at a given dock, etc.) to provide a set of functions to easily query these .json feeds and convert them to rectangular R data. Source code for that project can be found [here](https://github.com/ds-civic-data/gbfs)!

### Equity of Bikeshare Programs  

*October 2018 -- September 2019*

<img src="images/bikeshare.png" style="width:33%; border:1px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> Beginning as a final class project for Statistical Learning (MATH 243) at Reed College in Fall 2018, this research project focused on making use of machine learning methods to quantify progress in equity of bikeshare programs in the United States. Making use of [my R package gbfs](https://github.com/ds-civic-data/gbfs) to scrape latitude/longitudes of over 45,000 bikes across the country and joining that data with census demographic data, the project set out to determine the features of a community that are most salient in understanding the spatial distribution of bikes, and how these interact with different operating models of the programs. A preliminary report on this research [tied for second place](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usresp/2019/spring/winners) in the ASA-sponsored "Undergraduate Statistics Research Competition." A pre-print of further work on this project is currently in review, and a pre-print is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00129v1).

### Differentially Private Hypothesis Testing  

*May 2018 -- July 2019*


<img src="images/dpht.png" style="width:35%; border:1px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> The summer after my first year at Reed, I worked full-time in a research group on database privacy. In particular, we focused on the potential of nonparametric approaches to differentially private hypothesis testing. Differential privacy is a subfield of database anonymization where researchers can access sensitive information in a database (e.g. medical records) by sending a query (in our case, to run a hypothesis test) and being returned a privatized output (in our case, a noisy test statistic). Centrally, my role was to evaluate the power of the tests that the group developed through simulation in R. Source code for these projects can be found [here](https://github.com/simonpcouch/non-pm-dpht) and [here](https://github.com/simonpcouch/wilcoxon), and papers can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01635) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09364). An early report on the research, "A Differentially Private Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test", [tied for 1st prize](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usresp/2018/fall/winners) in the ASA-sponsored "Undergraduate Statistics Research Competition," and we were recently accepted to the Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in London!

### An Alternative to Rank-Based College Exploration 

*January 2019 -- May 2019*


<img src="images/network_viz.png" style="width:35%; border:1px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left"> This was a project completed for Statistics Practicum (MATH 343) at Reed College in Spring 2019 with [EJ Arce](https://github.com/ejarce) and [Alexander Moore](https://github.com/moorea1). In this work, we argued that newsmagazine college rankings like those provided by U.S. News are both unhelpful for prospective students and reinforce existing status obsession. As an alternative, we developed a data-centered tool that focuses on what makes a college similar to, not better than, another college. Data from IPEDS and the Mobility Report Card from the Equality of Opportunity Project were joined and provided to users in an R Shiny application that allows users to compare United States educational institutions through visualization, comparison of raw data, and model-based assessment of school similarity. That application is hosted live [here](https://shiny.reed.edu/s/users/couchs/colleges/), with source code and a copy of our final paper [here](https://github.com/simonpcouch/College-Exploration).

### anyflights (R Package, no longer supported)

*December 2017 -- December 2018*

This R package, inspired by the well-known [nycflights13](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) data-only R package, supplies a set of functions to query air travel data. The main wrapper function, *anyflights*, grabs data for a user-given year and airport and returns a folder of tidied datasets with identical formatting to that in *nycflights13*. The thought was to allow for students learning the basics of R and the tidyverse through labs working with the *nycflights13* package to work with more recent data from their own hometowns or from the airport closest to their school. An instructor could use this package to generate a folder of data (~5MB) that could be distributed to students through Dropbox, GitHub, etc. As a result, students could make discoveries that could impact their own, real-life air travel decisions. The formatting and querying structure of the data changed very often, though, and I decided to stop maintaining the package in late 2018. The source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/simonpcouch/anyflights)--let me know if you're interested in maintaining this package!
