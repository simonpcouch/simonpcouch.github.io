I'm a rising Junior statistics student at Reed College. I care about the use of data science for social good, and am especially interested in applications in sustainable agriculture. My current research focuses on privacy-preserving data analysis as well as applying statistical methods to quantify progress in equity of bikeshare programs. I also maintain some R software packages and work as a consultant to researchers at Reed to effectively utilize R and other data tools in their projects, and am currently working for John Deere as a Data Science Intern. Source code for many of my projects (including this website) is available on GitHub @simonpcouch!
