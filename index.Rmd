I'm a sophomore statistics student at Reed College interested in data science, R development, machine learning, data visualization, statistical theory, differentially private hypothesis testing, and the use of these tools for social good. My current research focuses on privacy-preserving data analysis as well as applying statistical methods to quantify progress in equity of bikeshare programs. I also maintain some R software packages and work as a consultant to researchers at Reed to effectively utilize R and other data tools in their projects, and will be working for John Deere as a Data Science Intern in Summer 2019. Source code for many of my projects (including this website) is available on GitHub @simonpcouch!
